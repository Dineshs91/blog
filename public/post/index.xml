      <title>A little about myself</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am a self taught programmer. It started out as a journey to explore the world of computers, the digital world. I started of with the fundamentals. I can say that my entire learning was a fruit of all the questions I’ve asked myself. Questions, Like how internet works ? I started programming just to answer this question “How does a c program make a computer do some work?”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In schools and colleges they’ve always taught us how to write c program in an editor, then compile and run. But I wasn’t able to connect the dots. How could this be making a computer work? I used to think. I found the answer to this. It was Turbo C, which by providing user friendliness was hiding something. Only after I used gcc, I understood the process. There can be two sides, one is user friendliness and the other is transparency. Take the example of windows and linux, windows is user friendly but hides a lot about what’s happening inside. But linux is very transparent in terms of what is happening. You can see the code for yourself. This is one of the reason’s that made me believe “ok C program can make computer do things”. I never said no to anything related to computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started with GUI programming in GTK. No wonder I started with GUI, as I was a windows user back then. After a couple of months I replaced windows with ubuntu. Using linux was very different. It gave me the feeling of a hacker. Typing commands in console, I felt like, I am actually interacting with the computer. Suddenly I felt empowered. I started learning about networking. Wireshark, tcpdump, airmon-ng using these tools I got to know what happens behind the scene. So I learnt some things about networking, which previously, I took for granted.
One day when I was using this tool scapy, I got very much interested in python. So I started learning python. The name was also very cool. It was very easy to learn. I opened python docs in browser and in console I opened python, and started typing commands. Actually I was programming Interactively. Then I started out with Interview Street. It is a platform where you can solve programming challenges. It was fascinating. Later Interview Street became Hackerrank. By solving those challenges, I got better at the way I think. I still solve challenges in Hackerrank. It’s good for my mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I got to know about git and github. It was intriguing, to know how github works. Distributed collaboration using git, remarkable.
Open source is a world that is always special to me.
All I understood was that I can learn things fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My brother was doing MBA in Information security. So I got to know about Nmap, Netcat, snort, nessus, rainbow tables etc. I also configured snort in my laptop. I also wrote a simple plugin for nessus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Programming made me confident, I have gone through one of the toughest times in my life without a lot of pain because of programming.
It was so addictive. I was very much in love with it, so much that I wasn’t thinking of anything else. It made me believe that I can do things.
Actual things that can be useful to others. Above all, it makes me very happy. It changed the way I think. I started to approach things in an efficient way, Thanks to programming.
I am very grateful to the community. I have never seen anything like that before. Great pioneers are part of it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Functional programming in python</title>
      <link>http://dineshs91.github.io/blog/post/functional_programming_python/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Python offers some good functions to the developers to write functional like code. But their use is not
recommended as it reduces code readability. They may come handy in some places though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an example program showing the use of functional concepts in python.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;T = input()

pi = &amp;quot;31415926535897932384626433833&amp;quot;

def calculate(song):
      words = map(lambda x: str(len(x)), song.split(&amp;quot; &amp;quot;))
      p = reduce(lambda a, b: a + b, words)

      if(p == pi[:len(p)]):
          print &amp;quot;It&#39;s a pi song.&amp;quot;
      else:
          print &amp;quot;It&#39;s not a pi song.&amp;quot;


for _ in range(T):
    song = raw_input()
    calculate(song)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

      <title>Migrating to hugo</title>
      <link>http://dineshs91.github.io/blog/post/welcome/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Migrating to hugo based blog. I am super exited to be using hugo, for my blog. The reason
I had to quit tumblr was due to missing syntax highlighting support. Moreover hugo is open
source and that itself is a great motivation for me to try it out. I will be moving all my
blogs to hugo, over the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How a programmer feels</title>
      <link>http://dineshs91.github.io/blog/post/programmer_feels/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is a very good quality, every amazing programmer has. It’s their love towards programming or the whole technology, surrounding computers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being a programmer myself, I have come across situations, where it was very frustrating to debug. It may take days, even weeks to find the issue. But we never give up. It’s like a battle between bug and the programmer. And you know what, we have this ego, there is nothing we can’t accomplish. Something like this, goes in our minds “Bug, you can’t hide from me for long. I am gonna get you soon”. Its the challenge, that makes it more fun and interesting. The degree of difficulty, is proportional to the degree of awesomeness, we feel solving it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally finding the bug, is liking finding a mythical creature. ‘Here you are, got you’. That particular moment of realisation, is incredible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok 1 down, 5 to go….&lt;/p&gt;
