    <p>Our <strong>imagination</strong> is a fantastic machine, which throws at us amazing idea’s. But our educated mind, discards it obviously (It&rsquo;s not practical it says). The best thing to do is, to write down that idea as soon as it comes out, otherwise the evil mind will wipe it off. Next question, where do i write it ? Almost all the existing platforms are online, but i don’t want this idea to be visible to the public (Not yet !). This is something that is very close to us and it should stay that way for sometime, before making a public debut.</p>
<p>The crazy internet world. No matter, which website we land on, it asks us to login. There are some sites where it is not necessary, but we definitely get the idea behind all of this. <strong><em>Can we trust these sites ?</em></strong> So the platform should not be an online one. An online platform is not all needed, for this purpose.</p>
<p>You can ask, why can’t we use a notebook instead of an app. This is a valid suggestion. But i don’t want to waste paper. Notebooks are very close to me. I keep writing everything down. You cannot see me at work, without a notebook/notepad. I wanted that kind of an experience in an application. Giving  something back to the mother earth and to the awesome people.</p>
<p>The name <strong>Devlog</strong> is short for developer log. This is a logbook, where you kind of log your daily activites as a developer(Not necessary). You can go look back at your logs and decide what to do. It&rsquo;s designed to assist you in keeping track of your notes and ideas in a simple way.</p>
<p>Data is our’s and we should own it. It definitely should stay that way until we choose otherwise.</p>
<p>If you are interested in this idea, please have a look at the <a href="https://github.com/Dineshs91/devlog">source</a> or take it for a spin and let me know your experience.</p>
