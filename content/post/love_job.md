Work takes up a significant part of our lives. So shouldn't we be loving our job ?

I would start this post by quoting Vivekananda

> Any fool can do what he loves, but only a great man can love anything he works on.

We all need some kind of a job to feed ourselves and our closed one's. So we find a job
that we don't love, but we take it for the purpose of survival. This leads to a highly
unsatisfied life. You are not only affecting your life, but you are affecting other live's
too. So it's a duty for each one of us, to find what we really love and go work on it. This one
is relatively easy, something that is widely believed in the western world. Most of the talks
I see, speak about following your passion etc etc.

This is where Indian spirituality shines. The spiritual giants have said love your work, it doesn't
matter if you like it or not. I strongly believe in this idea. This free's you further from the
attachment to work (your passion).

The goal of life is this, experience life with happiness. Say, if you get fired from the job that you
love so much, its not just the job that you are losing, but happiness goes away with it. The mantra
for limitless happiness is love what you do. If you are able to implement this perfectly, you will be
happy uncoditionally, because your happiness is not tied to any specific kind of work. You have
perfected the art of being happy.
