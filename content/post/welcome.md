Migrating to hugo based blog. I am super exited to be using hugo, for my blog. The reason
I had to quit tumblr was due to missing syntax highlighting support. Moreover hugo is open
source and that itself is a great motivation for me to try it out. I will be moving all my
blogs to hugo, over the coming weeks.
